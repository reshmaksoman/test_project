Select if you wish to keep your video on or off. Below you'll get a Meeting ID, which has to be shared with participants and let them join your Zoom meeting. You can also allow people with your meeting ID to directly join the room or you can disable this to require a password along with your meeting ID to join. Once this is set, tap Start a Meeting and your team is ready for a 'Zoom'.",

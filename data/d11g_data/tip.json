In this scenario, if the Captain and Vice-captain fail, there is a chance of losing. But, if both of them perform, there is a higher chance of winning the Grand League."

We can also make that player the Captain or Vc. If the 11th player plays well and Captain or Vice-captain perform well, the chances of grand league winning increase. If that player doesn’t perform well, the Captain or Vc can fetch our entry fees back. By this trick, I have got 1st rank in the Grand League. In a Pakistan vs Sri Lanka match, Usman Khan was my captain, and Fakhar Zaman was the Vice-captain, the rest of the team was ordinary. But, ahead of making the best player as Captain, I select Usman Khan as Captain. In that match, The selection percent was very less (5% approx) of Usman Khan. He had taken 5-wickets. As a result, I won the GL."

If you go to More, which is present in the bottom right corner, there's an option Allow participants to unmute themselves. If you uncheck this, none of the participants will be able to unmute themselves when they are muted, which means you'll have complete control over who speaks when in the meeting.\nAdditionally, you can also go to the Meetings tab, and mute all the participants at once."

		"content": "1. Dealing with microphone issues\nMany video-conferencing app users experience trouble with their microphones. An easy fix to this is ensuring that JioMeet has access to your microphone. For iOS users, you need to go into privacy in the settings and toggle the switch for microphone for the app if not done already. For Android users, they can go into App permissions under App notifications and then toggle the microphone option. If you are still facing problems, ensure that other apps are not using the microphone at the same time.\n\n2. Muting your mic\nBoth, the host and the participant have the option of muting the mic. The host can avoid any unnecessary disturbances during the meeting by muting a particular participant or all of them whereas the participant can mute to avoid any faux pas moments. You can always go into the settings options and click on the option – always mute my microphone – once you enter a meeting. Similarly, you can hide your video as well.\n\n3. secure your meetings\nWhen you start a new meeting, you have an option or showing your Personal Meeting ID or not. You should disable the PMI as anyone can join a meeting if he/she knows your PMI. You can also lock your meeting, preventing latecomers or unwanted users to join in. While recording your meetings or casting, keep in mind that JioMeet can capture anything that is being displayed on your device including passwords, photos etc.\n\n4.More controls for hosts\nAs a host, you can mute/unmute, enable/disable participants’ audio and video. You can even mute participants on entry as well. You can enable the waiting room so that you can add and remove participants as per your need. You also have an option of disabling participants from joining the meeting before you. You can automatically start recording the meeting as well. The host can also turn on the name of the participant once he/she joins in.\n\n5.Lesser-known features\nIn order to know how long have you been in a meeting there is an option ‘Show my connected time’ in the settings. There is a safe driving mode as well where you just need to tap to speak and your video will be turned off\n\n6. Make Video Feed of a participant full-screen\nWhen there are multiple participants in a meeting sharing their video feeds. Still, you do want to focus on a single video that could come in handy at situations such as Pinning the Teachers Video in the conference and more, you can make the video feed full screen. Here’s how:\nJust make a double click on the video feed of the participant to make the video go to full screen and do the same again to bring it back to the standard view.\n\n7.Schedule a Personal Room\nSuppose you are taking regular classes or scheduling regular meetings, instead of creating new meeting IDs or links, again and again, you could schedule a Personal Room whose Meeting ID and password remain constant. The same could be used for repeated meetings. Here’s how:\nOn the home screen of the JioMeet application, click on the New Meeting button, here you’ll find an option for Personal Meeting ID, enable that and make a note of it. Now just share that to the participants.\n\n8.Join Meeting in a Web-Browser\nIf you are using a device such as a Laptop or older generation devices that do not support the application, you could join the Meeting in a Web browser. Click on the link, and it will pop up an option to Launch in Web Browser. Click on that, Enter your Name, and join the Meeting.",

The QBZ95 spawns about 1.4x as often as the SCAR-L used to spawn on Sanhok."

Its base damage per shot is slightly lower than the other 7.62mm assault rifles, offset by its rate of fire being almost as fast as that of the Groza, allowing its overall damage per second to be significantly higher than the comparable AKM. This comes at the cost of significantly higher recoil that — unlike the AKM — can be reduced by attaching foregrips."

With higher base damage and muzzle velocity than the AKM, Beryl M762, or Groza, the Mutant does the most damage per shot of any assault rifle, and is easier to use at long range than its other 7.62mm brethren. However, it also has the smallest magazine size of any assault rifle and lacks a full-auto mode, which makes it more difficult to use in close-quarters engagements."

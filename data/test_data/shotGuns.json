S12K is quite devastating in close-range combats courtesy its capability of taking down multiple enemies through a semi-automatic feature and a high fire rate damage. The weapon uses the 12-gauge ammo and has a magazine size of 5 that can be extended to 8. "

The biggest drawback of this gun is the long reload time which is quite frustrating. So if you have fired off all your shots, the time to switch weapons has arrived.  "

All you have to do is be accurate with your shots because the gun has a long reload time and only a two-bullet magazine. This makes it quite tough to use. The gun has a base damage of 2."

Extended magazines are highly recommended as the reload time remains unchanged, while magazine capacity is almost doubled. "

				"description": "Right at home in its Eastern European origins, this weapon is exclusive to Erangel and Vikendi. While in full-auto, its best suited for quick and accurate sparring in close-range. Because of the unique helical magazine that runs along the barrel, this SMG doesn't support magazine upgrades or lower rail attachments. However, the weapon has high firing stability built-in, which allows for low recoil even without a grip. With only a muzzle and sight attachment to add, you'll have a fully kitted and reliable short-range weapon in your hands faster than ever before. "

The only downside of the UZI is that the damage dealt by the weapon is pretty low. However, if used correctly, UZI is a gun that comes in handy. It has a power rating of 25 and a rate of fire of 71. Other SMGs can also be used; they all depend on the playing style of the users and the players' proficiency with the gun. The MP5K is also a very good SMG with great stats but is only available in Vikendi."

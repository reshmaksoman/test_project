While they can do immediate damage, especially the Frag Grenade and Molotov Cocktail, they're best used as a denial weapon. By laying down fire and tossing these weapons into an area, you're denying this area to your adversary, allowing for greater control of their movement and their basic abilities. For instance, the Smoke Grenade can help obscure your movements, and the Stun Grenade can help to remove sight and sound from your adversary, at least temporarily.\n "

Molotov Cocktails can be used offensively, but don't bounce like other throwable weapons. Another potential use of a molotov cocktail is area denial. If you set the staircase on fire, players will not be able to pursue you up to higher floors, and you can use this extra time to set up a kill zone or escape off a balcony. Molotov cocktails can also be used defensively to obscure an enemy's line of sight, similar to a Smoke Grenade.\n Throwing a Molotov Cocktail is a two step process\nPress and HOLD the left mouse button to prime your molotov. This will start the detonation timer.\nWhen ready, release the left mouse button to launch your molotov along the parabolic arc outlined for you. "

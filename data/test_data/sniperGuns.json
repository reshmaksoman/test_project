If you are lucky enough to kill a person possessing an AWM, you can loot it from him/her as well. AWM uses .300mm magnum rounds and has to be used very carefully. It gives a maximum damage of 105 and has the longest range. An AWM with an 8x scope is a deadly combination. Make sure that you have good aim before opting for an AWM as bullets are limited. "

One of the major disadvantages of this sniper is that you cannot attach a scope to it, thus rendering the main essence of sniping useless. It, thus cannot be used for long-range shooting. The gun provides a damage of 66. "
